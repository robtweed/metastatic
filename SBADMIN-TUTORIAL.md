# MetaStatic Tutorial

### Building a Web Site Using the SB Admin Meta Tag Library

# Introduction

The MetatStatic Repository includes a Tag Library that provides a partial implementation of the [SB Admin](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/sb-admin-pro) User Interface.  What's included is sufficient to demonstrate:

- how a technical developer can build out such a Meta Tag Library
- how a Web Site maintainer can build and maintain a site using such a Tag Library

In this tutorial we'll explain in detail both aspects so that by the end of the tutorial you can begin to use MetaStatic for your own specific purposes.

# Getting Started

MetaStatic is written in JavaScript and therefore requires either Node.js or Bun.js to run.

In this tutorial I'm going to use Bun as it's a lot faster to run and much simpler to set up and maintain than Node.js, but if you're a Node.js developer it should be straightforward to translate the instructions to make them work with Node.js.

This tutorial also assumes that you'll be using a Linux machine.  Bun.js is also available for Windows and MacOS and once installed, all the commands should work identically apart from file path syntax differences.

So let's get started!

## Create a Work Directory

Create a directory for this tutorial and switch to it.

For example:

```code
mkdir mstutorial
cd mstutorial
```

## Install Bun.js

If you're using Linux or MacOS, the recommended way to install Bun.js is as follows:

```code
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

If you're using Windows, [refer to the Bun.js documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).


## Clone the MetaStatic Repository

```code
git clone https://github.com/robtweed/metastatic
```

## Switch to the Repository's */examples* directory

cd metastatic/examples


## Start the Included Bun.js Web Server

We've included a basic but handy Web Server.  It's written in Bun.js and uses its extremely fast *Bun.serve* HTTP server.  This Web Server will allow you to quickly view the Web Site file(s) you generate in this tutorial directly from the location in which MetaStatic will create them.  

Note that this Web Server is **NOT** meant for production use!  

You'll see the Bun Web Server in the directory that you've previously switched to:

```code
bunws.js
```

and you can [view its source code here](./examples/bunws.js).

Note also that the file(s) generated by MetaStatic can be served up by any Web Server, so once you're happy with them, simply upload them to your Web Server.  You will, of course, need to ensure that any URL paths for images etc that you might use are correctly structured for your production Web Server.

To start the Web Server, just issue the following command from the */examples* directory:

```code
bun bunws.js
```

This will start the Web Server and it will listen on port 3000.  If you're already using that port for something else, Bun will report an error and fail to start.  If so, you can specify a different port, eg:

```code
bun bunws.js 8080
```

Note: the first time you invoke this command, Bun will automatically install all of the Web Server's dependencies.

## Test the Web Server

The Bun Web Server is automatically configured to fetch static files from the */examples/sites* folders.  You can test it with the *demo* site which includes a pre-built *index.html* file.  In another process, type:

```code
curl http://localhost:3000/demo/index.html
```

or point a browser at this same URL.

if you followed the instructions correctly, you should see the file's contents or see them rendered in your browser.

If so, you're ready to begin exploring MetaStatic!

# The SB Admin Tag Library

## Background

You'll find the SB Admin Tag Library in your */examples/MetaTagLibraries/sbadmin* directory.

You can also see the [source files here](./examples/MetaTagLibraries/sbadmin).

The SB Admin User Interface (UI) is designed around a set of panels:

- a top bar, for titles etc
- a left-hand panel for menu options
- a footer panel for site information, copyright notices etc
- a main content panel

This UI is based on the popular Open Source responsive Bootstrap v5 CSS framework.  The built-in responsive behaviour is very nice: for example, you'll find that the menu panel will automatically collapse on small devices such as phones, and content will automatically stack vertically in small devices.

As such, the SB Admin UI is very powerful and versatile and can be used for many, if not most Web Sites to provide a modern UI for your content.

Of course, with MetaStatic you aren't limited to using this UI: any alternative UI can be implemented as a set of MetaStatic's Meta Tags and then used to construct your Web Site.  Their design is entirely up to you!

The *namespace* we've used for the SB Admin Tag Library is *sbadmin*, so you'll notice that all the individual Tag definition files are prefixed with this, eg:

- sbadmin-root
- sbadmin-header
- sbadmin-menu

Each Meta Tag is defined in its own file which has a file extension of *.mst*, eg:

- sbadmin-root.mst
- sbadmin-header.mst
- sbadmin-menu.mst

A Web Developer/Maintainer will use these as tags, eg:

- &lt;sbadmin-root>
- &lt;sbadmin-header>
- &lt;sbadmin-menu>


## The Root Meta Tag

Every MetaStatic Tag Library will have a top-level tag within which all other Tags are nested.  What it's called is up to you.  In our case we've named this tag *sbadmin-root*.

You'll find it in your system at */examples/MetaTagLibraries/sbadmin/sbadmin-root.mst*.

You can also inspect its [source code here](./examples/MetaTagLibraries/sbadmin/sbadmin-root.mst).

We'll come back to explain its contents and how/why it works in detail later.

For now, suffice to say that this Meta Tag:

- creates the correct HTML &lt;head> tag contents for your Web Site:
  - loading the required Bootstrap-compatible CSS resources;
  - loading the Bootstrap JavaScript resources
  - loading the Open Source Feather icon resources
  - adding some specific customisable styles
- defines and creates the basic UI layout in the &lt;body> tag


## Creating Our Web Site

Let's get started and create a "bare bones" SB Admin Web Site.

Change to the */examples/sites/tutorial* directory that you'll find on your system.

In order to create a Web Site, you create a file with a file extension of *.meta*.  The file name is otherwise up to you, but by convention, a single page Web Site will normally have a name of *index*.

You'll find we've already created an instance of the *index.meta* file for you to get you started.  It's very simple and just contains the *sbadmin-root* tag and defines a value for its *title* attribute:

```html
<sbadmin-root title="MetaStatic Demo" />
```

Let's try building a Web Site from it.


## Running the MetaStatic Builder

You're best to run the MetaStatic Builder from within your */examples* directory:

- change to the correct directory, eg:

```code
cd ~/mstutorial/metastatic/examples
```

Then run the Builder:

```code
bun build.mjs tutorial
```

Specifying *tutorial* as a command line parameter will tell the builder to find your definition *.meta* file in your */sites/tutorial* directory.  By default it will look for and use a file named *index.meta*.  You could specify it explicitly by adding it as a second command line parameter:

```code
bun build.mjs tutorial index.meta
```

You should see the generated HTML returned in the terminal, but that same HTML should now be in a file named *index.html* in your */examples/sites/tutorial* directory.  

Try fetching it in a browser (making use of the Bun Web Server we started earlier):

```code
http://localhost:3000/tutorial/index.html
```

You should see an empty version of the SB Admin UI!

Clearly this isn't very useful as yet, but it's worth taking a look at what's been generated and why.

If you inspect the contents of the generated *index.html* file, you'll see that it includes everything that was needed to render this UI:

```html
<html>

  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <title>MetaStatic Demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sb-admin-pro.startbootstrap.com/css/styles.css">
    <script async="async" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/feather-icons/dist/feather.min.js" onload="feather.replace()"></script>
    <script async="async" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    <style>
      .navbar-nav-scroll {
        max-height: var(--bs-scroll-height, 100vh);
        overflow-y: auto;
      }

      .bg-mgw {
        opacity: 0.9;
        background-color: #bdddf6;
        background-image: ;
      }

      .sidenav-light {
        background-color: #fff;
        color: #212832;
      }

      main {
        background-color: #f2f6fc;
        color: #69707a;
      }

      .bg-light {
        background-color: rgb(242, 246, 252) !important;
        color: #69707a;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body onload="init()" class="nav-fixed">
    <nav class="topnav navbar navbar-expand shadow navbar-mgw bg-mgw">
    </nav>
    <div id="layoutSidenav">
      <div id="layoutSidenav_nav">
        <nav class="sidenav shadow-right sidenav-light navbar-nav-scroll" id="sidenavAccordion">
        </nav>
      </div>
      <div id="layoutSidenav_content">
        <main>
          <div class="container-fluid px-4">
          </div>
        </main>
        <footer class="py-4 bg-light mt-auto">
          <div class="container-fluid px-4">
            <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between small">
            </div>
          </div>
        </footer>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script>
      function init() {}
    </script>
  </body>

</html>
```

Notice how the &lt;title> tag has used the title attribute value we specified in the &lt;sbadmin-root> tag:

```html
    <title>MetaStatic Demo</title>
```

It might not look like it yet, but this *sbadmin-root* tag has already generated all the basic scaffolding needed to create your own customised version of the SB Admin UI, with empty versions of:

- a top bar, for titles etc
- a left-hand panel for menu options
- a footer panel for site information, copyright notices etc
- a main content panel

So in our next step we'll look at how you use and populate each of the four panel areas it's created for you.
