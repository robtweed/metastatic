# CSS/JavaScript Templates

Meanwhile, there are a great many pre-built templates that can be used to create complex, modern, responsive user interfaces for static web sites, with the entire content and functionality delivered as a single HTML page.  See for example:

- the [W3 Schools W3.CSS Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_templates.asp)
- the [SB Admin Dashboard Template](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2)

Templates such as these  don't require anything other than their own pre-defined CSS stylesheets and some behaviour-specific JavaScript files.  They don't require React, Vue, Angular or any other build and runtime framework.  As a result they are incredibly fast to load and run, and, being static HTML files, can be crawled and indexed completely for use by all search engines.

Whilst impressive in terms of their look and feel and functionality, tailoring such templates for a specific use case is, however, time-consuming, error-prone and fiddly, and requires a good understanding of HTML and JavaScript.  For a full web site, the page would be huge, and making content changes would require scanning or searching the HTML page and editing in situ.  More complex modifications, such as adding or changing new menu options, tabbed panels or content sections would probably be beyond the skills of a basic Web Site maintainer and would be a cumbersome task.
