# Content Management Systems

For Web Sites that require maintenance of a lot of content that can change over time, the usual solution is to use a Content Management System (CMS).  This requires specific technical skills and a potentially steep learning curve,  and often the cost of a license for the CMS and/or associated database.  The latter database may also need technical maintenance (eg backup, restore etc), again requiring specific technical expertise.

As a result, many Web Site maintainers turn to commercial packaged solutions such as Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace etc, most of which incur licensing or subscription costs and/or remote/cloud hosting, and potentially constraining the look and feel of the Web Site.  Migrating between such services can also be problematic, so vendor lock-in is a real risk of such a solution.
