*MetaStatic* is a JavaScript tool that allows you to build and maintain a static web site using:

- high-level tags that we call *Meta Tags* and that represent and encapsulate a particular set of user interface (UI) features and behaviours
- optionally, a simple text file-based Content Management System, with your content written using Markdown syntax

*MetatStatic* can be used with either Node.js or Bun.js.

Using *MetaStatic*, a Web Site maintainer can quickly and easily define and maintain a complex static web site that has a modern responsive user interface, using a few simple Meta Tags and without the need for complex JavaScript frameworks.

*MetaStatic* allows a Web Site to be described/defined completely declaratively, requiring no programming knowledge or expertise.

However, technical developers can create libraries of re-usable *MetaStatic* Meta Tags that encapsulate any amount of markup and JavaScript logic, to whatever degree of complexity is required.  These can then be used by a Web Site maintainer as building-blocks that describe the Web Site.

The file containing the Meta Tag-based definition of a web site is then used as the input to the *MetaStatic* module which converts it to a corresponding HTML file that can be run in a browser.
