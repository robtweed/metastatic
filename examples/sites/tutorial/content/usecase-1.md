# JavaScript Frameworks

Many people these days are using complex and cumbersome JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue or Angular, to create what are actually just static Web Sites where the content is largely fixed and only occasionally updated.

This isn't perhaps so much of an issue if the maintainer of such a Web Site is technically well-versed in such a framework, but, more often than not, the maintainer is someone else in the organisation who has little or no detailed technical or programming expertise, but is more focused on ensuring that the content required for the site is accurate and kept up to date.  Such a Web Site maintainer will find it difficult to learn and understand the complexities involved when changes need to be made, and, nine times out of ten will need to go back to the original developer (if they are still available!) in order to make the change.

In any case, the use of such frameworks to create such Web Sites is often an unnecessary "sledgehammer to crack a nut".

Furthermore, such a site will typically  be slow to load and start for users, because it will require potentially huge files of JavaScript to be loaded into the browser before anything can begin to be rendered.

And just to add insult to injury, Web Sites developed using JavaScript frameworks that dynamically build the markup by manipulating the page DOM can be difficult for web crawlers to properly and fully process and index the content for search engines to use, resulting in sub-optimal Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).
