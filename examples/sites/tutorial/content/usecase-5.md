Furthermore, if the text content of the Web Site could be held separately, maintained in simple text files in a directory, using the now widely used and easily understood Markdown syntax (using any convenient editor from *nano* upwards!), then this content could be pulled in at build time for inclusion in the final template file.  All this would require is a simple file naming convention and the ability to reference the corresponding file name in a Meta Tag that made use of that content.

No database would be needed, and no license or subscription fees needed.  All that would be needed would be a basic understanding of a server's directory structure and the ability to use a text editor and devise a simple file nomeclature convention.
